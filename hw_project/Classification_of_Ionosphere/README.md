# Programming Assignment: Classification of  Ionosphere Data Set
1. Benchmark Dataset : The machine learning model solves the problem of classifying the ionosphere data set from the UCI data repository and determining whether the radar returns are good or bad in the ionosphere. This data set can be downloaded from the following web page: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere
2. Machine Learning Models : The following three types of machine learning models are learned and their performances are evaluated.
2-1 Canonical Models : performing experiments by selecting two or more learning models. For example, Decision Tree, MLP, SVM.  
2-2. Committee Machines : performing experiments with committee machines such as Random Forest and Ada Boost.
2-3. Deep Learning Models : performing experiments with deep learning models such as CNN and RBM. For the implementation of the learning models, you can use Scikit-Learn's packages or other possible sources.
